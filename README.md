This book, apparently, annotates rhymes in a good number of Fu. 

Suzuki Torao 鈴木虎雄. Fu shi da yao 賦史大要. Translated by Di ping xian chuban 
she 地平線出版社. Taibei: Di ping xian, 1963. (Looks like this is the original -- Suzuki Torao 鈴木虎雄, 賦史大要 Fushi taiyō, Tokyo 冨山房 Shōwa 11 [1936]). SOAS doesn't have it, but Cambridge has both. 

This article, has rhyme judgements from the Tai xuan jing 太玄經 by Yang Xiong 杨雄, not otherwise included in Luo and Zhou 1958.
